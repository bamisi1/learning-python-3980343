# This is python learning joueny for Brian Amisi, join me.
# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for variables and basic types


# Basic data types in Python: Numbers, Strings, Booleans 
# Variable names must start with a letter or _, and can have numbers. They are case sensitive. 
myint = 10
myfloat = 13.2576
mystr = "This is a string"
mybool = True

# We can display the content of a variable using the print() function

# print(myint)
# print(myfloat)
# print(mybool)

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables

# print(myint + myfloat)
# print(myint * myfloat)
# print(myint / myfloat)
# print(myint% 3)
another_str = "This is another string" 

# print(mystr + another_str)
# print ("nom " *3)
#you cant add diffent data types

# Logical and comparison operators 
# print(myint==10)
# print(myfloat !=20)
# print(myint>10)
# print(myfloat < 20)
#print(not (myfloat>26 and myint<15))
# re-declaring a variable works
myint = "this  redeclared"
print(myint)
